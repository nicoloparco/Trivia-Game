# Trivia-Game Features
This app is a trivia game powered using javascript and jQuery that provided the user a set of multiple choice questions to answer.
Each question is dynamically added to or removed from the page based on which answer is clicked.
Based on whether the correct on incorrect answer is chosen the user will be provided with feedback which included a message and a GIF.
Each question has a timer and if an answer is not chosen before the timer reaches 0 the app will move on to the following question.
After the game is over, a message will be displayed with the number of correct answers chosen out of the total amount of questions.
